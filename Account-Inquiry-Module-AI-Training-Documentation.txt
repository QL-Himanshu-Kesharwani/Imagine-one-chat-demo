4. Functional Workflows
Workflow 4.1: Search and Locate Patient Account
User Goal: Find specific patient account for billing inquiry
Steps:

. Click in search field at top of Account Inquiry screen
. Enter search criteria:
○ Account number (e.g., "256010") - most direct
○ Patient name (Last, First)
○ Medical record number
○ Social Security Number (last 4 digits)
. Press Enter or click search icon
. System returns matching account(s)
. If multiple matches, select correct patient from list
. Account details populate on screen
System Behavior:

Search is performed against Patient Master file
● Partial name searches supported (e.g., "ROD" returns RODGERS)
● Inactive accounts excluded by default (toggle setting available)
● Most recent visit displays first
●

Common Issues:

No results: Verify patient is registered in system
Multiple results: Use additional identifiers (DOB, account number)
● Slow search: Database indexing may be needed
●
●

Workflow 4.2: Review Account Balance and Status
User Goal: Understand total balance and who owes what
Steps:

. Locate patient account (see Workflow 4.1)

. Review Status Summary panel (center screen)
. Identify key balance components:
○ Total Balance: Overall amount due
○ Ins. Balance: Amount insurance owes
○ Pat. Balance: Amount patient owes
. Check Status field for account state (Open/Closed/On Hold)
. Review last payment dates to assess activity
. Check Collections fields for bad debt status
Business Rules:

Total Balance = Insurance Balance + Patient Balance
● Insurance balance remains until EOB posts
● Patient balance calculated after insurance adjudication
● Status "On Hold" prevents claim submission
● Collections amounts removed from active AR
●

Interpretation Guide:

High Ins. Balance, $0 Pat. Balance: Awaiting insurance payment
● $0 Ins. Balance, High Pat. Balance: Patient responsibility established
● Balances with old "last payment" dates: Likely stuck in AR, needs
follow-up
● Collections WO or Bad Debt WO > $0: Account has bad debt history
●

Workflow 4.3: View Charge Details
User Goal: Investigate specific charges on account
Steps:

. Navigate to Account Charges tab (default view)

● Modifier codes display with procedure
●

Key Fields for AR Research:
●

"3-0" = Primary paid, secondary billed
○ "Denial" = Denied by payer
● Claim Status: Electronic submission status
○ "ACC" = Accepted by payer
○ "REJ" = Rejected, needs correction
● Tickler/Action: Follow-up task assigned
○

. System queries clearinghouse for real-time status
. Review returned claim status and payer response
Claim Status Values:

ACC - Accepted by Payer: Claim received and accepted
REJ - Rejected: Claim has errors, needs correction
● PEND - Pending: In clearinghouse queue
● DENY - Denied: Payer denied payment
● (blank): Not yet submitted electronically
●
●

Follow-Up Actions:

Accepted: Monitor for payment within payer timeframe
Rejected: Review error codes, correct, resubmit
● Denied: Review denial reason, determine appeal vs adjustment
● Pending: Check back in 24-48 hours
●
●

7. User Questions the AI Should Answer
Account Lookup Questions
Q: How do I find a patient's account?
A: Enter the patient's account number, name, or medical record number in the
search field at the top of the Account Inquiry screen and press Enter. The
system will return matching accounts. If searching by name, use format "Last,
First" for best results. If multiple matches appear, select the correct patient
from the list.
Q: Why can't I find this patient?
A: The patient may not be registered in the system, the account may be marked
inactive, or there may be a spelling variation. Try searching with partial name,
date of birth, or last 4 digits of SSN. Verify with registration if the patient
should exist in the system.
Q: What does the account number mean?
A: The account number is a unique identifier assigned to each patient when
they're registered. It's used throughout the system to link all visits, charges,
and payments to the patient. This number doesn't change even if patient
demographics are updated.

Balance Questions
Q: Why is there a balance if insurance paid?
A: The balance could be patient responsibility (deductible, coinsurance, copay,
or non-covered services). Check the Status Summary: if "Ins. Balance" is $0
and "Pat. Balance" shows an amount, this is what the patient owes. Review the
charge details and EOB to see why the patient is responsible.
Q: What's the difference between Insurance Balance and Patient Balance?
A: Insurance Balance is the amount owed by the insurance company (still
awaiting payment or adjudication). Patient Balance is the amount the patient is
responsible for paying (after insurance processing). Total Balance is the sum of
both.
Q: Why does the balance keep changing?
A: Balances update in real-time as payments post, adjustments are made,
insurance processes claims, or additional charges are added. Each financial
transaction (payment, adjustment, new charge) recalculates the account
balance.
Q: How do I see what the patient actually owes?
A: Look at the "Pat. Balance" field in the Status Summary panel. This shows
current patient responsibility after insurance processing. For detailed
breakdown, review the Account Charges tab to see which specific charges have
patient balances.
Q: What does "In Collections" mean?
A: This amount has been sent to a collections agency for recovery. It's removed
from your active AR balance and is being pursued by the external agency. The

"Collection WO" or "Bad Debt WO" fields show amounts written off as
uncollectible.

Charge and Claim Questions
Q: How do I know if a claim was sent to insurance?
A: Check the Bill Stage field in the charge details. Stages starting with "2-"
indicate the claim was sent to primary insurance. "3-" means sent to
secondary, etc. Also check the Claim Status field for electronic submission
confirmation (e.g., "ACC - Accepted by Payer").
Q: What does "Pending Primary Response" mean?
A: The claim has been sent to the primary insurance and you're waiting for
them to process it and send payment or denial. This is a normal status between
claim submission and receiving the EOB.
Q: Why is this charge on hold?
A: Right-click the charge and look at the Hold details, or expand the charge
detail panel to see the "Reason" field. Common reasons include: missing
authorization, invalid insurance, pending information, or manual hold for review.
Release the hold once the issue is resolved.
Q: How do I see the procedure description?
A: In the Account Charges tab, the Procedure column shows both the CPT/
HCPCS code and the description (e.g., "A9575 - INJECTION, GADOTE"). For
more detail, expand the charge using the Show Detail toggle.
Q: What's a duplicate charge and how do I find it?
A: A duplicate charge is the same procedure billed twice for the same date of
service. The system may auto-flag duplicates with a hold reason "DUPCH Duplicate Charge". Review the procedure code, date of service, and units to
identify duplicates in the charge list.

Payment Questions
Q: Where can I see all payments made on this account?
A: Click the "Charge \ Payment History" tab to see a chronological list of all
payments, adjustments, and transactions. For a summarized view, go to Action
Menu → Payments → View Payment Summary.
Q: How do I know if a payment came from insurance or the patient?
A: In the Payment History tab, the payer column shows who made the payment.
Insurance payments will show the insurance carrier name; patient payments
show "Patient" or the patient name. Check the payment source field for check
numbers or payment method.
Q: Why doesn't the payment match the charge amount?
A: Insurance typically pays according to contracted rates, which are less than
billed charges. The difference is written off as a contractual adjustment.
Patients may pay partial amounts or have payment plans. Review the charge
detail to see payments, adjustments, and remaining balance.

Follow-Up and Tickler Questions
Q: How do I set a reminder to follow up on this charge?
A: Right-click the charge and select an appropriate hold action (e.g., "Set To

Mail Return"), OR use Action Menu → Set Charge Action/Next Contact. Enter
the tickler type, action, next contact date, and reason. The charge will appear
in your work queue on the scheduled date.
Q: What's the difference between Tickler and Action?
A: Tickler is the broad category of follow-up (e.g., "Denial"), while Action is the
specific task to perform (e.g., "Appeal Letter"). Together they define what
needs to be done and why.
Q: How do I assign this to someone else's work queue?
A: After setting the follow-up, use Action Menu → Assign to Tickler Bucket,
then select the user or team bucket you want to assign it to. The charge will
appear in their work queue.

Insurance and Eligibility Questions
Q: How do I check if the patient's insurance is active?
A: Go to Action Menu → Clearinghouse → Eligibility. The system will perform a
real-time check with the payer and return coverage status, effective dates, and
benefit information. Active coverage shows eligibility confirmed; inactive means
coverage has terminated.
Q: What if eligibility check fails or shows "No Response"?
A: The payer's system may be temporarily unavailable. Wait a few minutes and
try again. If it continues failing, verify the policy number and patient information
are correct. You may need to call the payer directly for verification.
Q: Where do I see the patient's insurance information?
A: The Insurance Information panel on the right side of the screen shows plan
name, carrier, policy number, group number, authorization, and subscriber
details for the current visit.

Statement and Collections Questions
Q: How do I generate a statement for the patient?
A: Action Menu → Patient Follow-Up → Create Instant Statement. This
generates a statement you can print, email, or post to the patient portal
immediately. Batch statements are also generated automatically based on your
organization's schedule.
Q: Why did this account go to collections?
A: Accounts are sent to collections when they meet specific criteria: typically
120+ days past due, minimum balance threshold, documented patient contact
attempts, and not in a payment plan or dispute. Check the "In Collections" field
and the Account Notes for collections history.
Q: How do I set up a payment plan?
A: Action Menu → Patient Follow-Up → Budget Plan. This opens the payment
plan setup where you can enter the plan terms, monthly amount, and schedule.
Once created, the account receives modified statements showing the plan.

Action Menu Questions
Q: What does "Transfer Charge" do?
A: This moves a charge from one patient account to another. Use this when a
charge was posted to the wrong patient account. This requires supervisor-level

permissions and creates an audit trail of the transfer.
Q: How do I write off a small balance?
A: Action Menu → Payments → Adjust Charge(s). Select the charge, choose
"Small Balance Write-Off" as the adjustment type, enter the amount, and select
the appropriate reason code. Balances are typically written off if under $5-10
per your organization's policy.
Q: What's the difference between "Hold All" and "Hold Selected"?
A: "Hold All" places every charge on the account on hold, preventing the entire
account from billing. "Hold Selected" only holds the specific charges you've
highlighted in the charge grid. Use "Hold Selected" when only certain charges
need to be held.
Q: Can I undo a write-off?
A: Yes, use Action Menu → Patient Follow-Up → Undo Write-Off/Turnover. This
reverses the write-off adjustment and restores the balance to active AR. This is
commonly used when a collections agency returns an account or when a writeoff was posted in error.

Status and Workflow Questions
Q: What does "ACC - Accepted by Payer" mean?
A: This is the clearinghouse response indicating the insurance company
received and accepted the electronic claim. It means the claim passed initial
edits and is in the payer's system for processing. This does not mean payment
is approved—just that the claim was received.
Q: Why does Bill Stage show "Denial" in red?
A: The claim was denied by the payer. This is a critical status that requires
action. Review the denial reason, determine if it's correctable, and either
appeal or adjust based on your organization's policy. Set a tickler for follow-up.
Q: What's the difference between Status "Open" and "Closed"?
A: "Open" means the account has an outstanding balance and is active in the
billing system. "Closed" means the balance is zero and no further billing is
expected. Accounts can reopen if new charges post or adjustments create a
balance.

8. Edge Cases & Troubleshooting
Data Mismatches
Issue: Balance shown doesn't match detailed charge review
Causes:

Unapplied payments or credits
● Pending adjustments not yet posted
● System calculation timing (batch vs real-time)
● Hidden charges (filtered out of view)
●

Resolution:

. Disable all filters in charge grid
. Run Account Balance Reconciliation report
. Review Payment History for unapplied amounts
. Check for credit balances

. Contact system administrator if discrepancy persists
Issue: Insurance shows as primary but claim billing to patient
Causes:

Insurance inactive on date of service
● Eligibility verification failed
● Insurance flagged as "Bill Patient"
● Coverage terminated
●

Resolution:

. Check Insurance Information panel for effective dates
. Run eligibility verification
. Review insurance priority in patient insurance file
. Verify coverage was active on service date
. Update insurance or rebill if appropriate
Issue: Claim shows "Accepted" but no payment received after 45+ days
Causes:

Payer processing delays
● Claim in payer review/audit
● Payment lost in mail
● Payment posted to different account
● Claim denied but status not updated
●

Resolution:

. Use Clearinghouse → Claim Status for real-time check
. Call payer for claim status
. Check if payment posted to different patient
. Request payer reprocessing if claim lost
. Document all contact in Account Notes

Permission Issues
Issue: User cannot release hold on charge
Causes:

Insufficient permission level
● Hold type requires supervisor approval
● Account in collections (locked)
●

Resolution:

. Verify user has "Hold/Release" permission
. Check hold type—some require supervisor
. Escalate to supervisor for release
. Contact system admin for permission review
Issue: "Access Denied" when trying to adjust charge
Causes:

User lacks adjustment permissions
● Adjustment amount exceeds user limit
●

●

Charge status prevents adjustment (e.g., paid in full)

Resolution:

. Verify adjustment permissions in user profile
. Check if amount exceeds authority limit
. Request supervisor override if needed
. Ensure charge is in adjustable status

System Behavior Issues
Issue: Charge not appearing in grid
Causes:

Filters active (e.g., date range, status)
● Charge posted to different visit
● Charge deleted or voided
● Display limit reached (e.g., showing first 100 only)
●

Resolution:

. Clear all filters (reset view)
. Check "View Last Visit First" toggle
. Search by charge ID directly
. Verify charge wasn't voided in Charge Entry
. Check if pagination is limiting display
Issue: Balance not updating after payment posted
Causes:

Payment batch not finalized
● System cache not refreshed
● Payment unapplied (not linked to charge)
● Payment voided or reversed
●

Resolution:

. Refresh screen (F5 or close/reopen)
. Verify payment batch is finalized
. Check Payment History for payment status
. Confirm payment allocated to correct charges
. Contact system admin if balance calculation error

Workflow Confusion
Issue: Unsure what action to take on denied claim
Causes:

Denial reason unclear
● No standard process defined
● Multiple denial codes present
●

Resolution:

. Review denial reason code in claim detail
. Check payer contract for denial policy
. Common actions:
○ Correctable error → Fix and rebill

Authorization issue → Obtain auth, appeal
○ Timely filing → Appeal immediately
○ Non-covered service → Transfer to patient or adjust
. Set appropriate tickler for tracking
. Consult billing supervisor if uncertain
○

Issue: Patient balance showing when insurance should be responsible
Causes:

Insurance denied as patient responsibility
Deductible or coinsurance applied
● Service not covered by plan
● Incorrect COB (coordination of benefits)
●
●

Resolution:

. Review EOB for denial/adjustment reason
. Verify insurance coverage for procedure
. Check if deductible/coinsurance applies
. Confirm insurance was primary on DOS
. Appeal if insurance should cover, or bill patient if legitimate patient
responsibility

9. AI Interpretation Notes
Critical Context for AI Response
When answering user questions about Account Inquiry, the AI must always
consider:

. User Role Context: Billing specialists, AR reps, and supervisors have
different permission levels and workflow needs
. Timing Sensitivity: Many questions are time-sensitive (claim
deadlines, payment follow-up)
. Financial Impact: Balance and payment questions affect cash flow
and patient satisfaction
. Compliance Requirements: Billing rules, payer contracts, and
regulations constrain actions
. Workflow State: Where the account/charge is in the billing cycle
determines appropriate next steps
