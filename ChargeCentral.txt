Charge Central – End-to-End Charge Flow Reference

1. Purpose of This Document
This document explains the end-to-end charge flow in Charge Central. It is designed to:
- Help humans understand how a charge moves from intake to release
- Serve as foundational context for an AI bot
- Reduce guesswork and downstream claim denials

2. High-Level Charge Flow Overview
Charge Intake / Load
Charge Review & Validation
Hold / Bucket Assignment
Charge Correction & Completion
Audit & Eligibility Checks
Charge Release

3. Charge Intake & Load
Batch Number, Bucket, Filter define grouping and work queues.

4. Patient & Visit Context
Each charge is associated with Patient ID, Visit Number, Location, POS.

5. Charge Detail Section
Key fields:
Procedure Code, Date of Service, Units, Provider IDs, Diagnosis, Modifiers, Department Code, POS.

6. Validation Engine & Holds
Validation Failed blocks release if any rule fails.

7. Buckets & Status Control
Examples: New, Validation Failed, Pending Review, Ready for Release.

8. Tools & Actions
Auto Fill, LCD Check, Eligibility, Charge Audit.

9. Charge Release Logic
Release only when all required fields pass and no holds exist.

10. Configuration Areas
Mapping Tables, Validation Rules, Bucket Configuration.

11. Terminology
Charge Readiness, Hold, Validation Failed, Bucket, Release.

12. Bot Support
The bot uses this as source of truth.

13. Screen Fields & Indicators
Status indicators and core fields affect readiness.

14. Common Failure Scenarios
Missing fields, mapping issues, hidden validation.

15. Final Principle
Charge Central is deterministic: data, mapping, validation rules determine release.
