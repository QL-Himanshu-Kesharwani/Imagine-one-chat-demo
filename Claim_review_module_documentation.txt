All other displayed columns

Business Rules & Logic
Claim Display Rules
1. Claim Count Display:
Header shows total claim count and aggregate charge amount
Format: [Count] Claims (Total Charge Amount) $[Amount]
Example: "339 Claims (Total Charge Amount) $250,342.10"
Updates dynamically based on active filters
2. Charge Count Display:
When claim is expanded, shows number of charges
Format: [Count] Charge or [Count] Charges
Example: "1 Charge", "2 Charges"
3. Row Selection:

Only one claim can be expanded at a time
Selecting a new claim collapses the previously selected claim
Selected row highlighted in blue
Hold Logic
1. Claim Hold Status:
Claims on hold cannot be released for billing
Hold can be applied at claim level or plan level
Hold notes document reason for hold
Holds must be manually removed before release
2. Plan-Level Holds:
Applying hold to plan affects all claims for that plan
Used for systemic issues (contract disputes, credential issues, etc.)
Overrides individual claim release status

Warning Indicators
1. Timely Filing Warning:
Appears at charge level
Boolean flag (True/False)
True = Approaching or past timely filing deadline
Requires immediate attention to avoid denial
2. Appeal Warning:
Appears at charge level
Boolean flag (True/False)
True = Appeal deadline approaching or special handling required

Validation Rules
1. Date of Service:
Cannot be future-dated
Must fall within coverage period
Should align with patient eligibility dates
2. Charge Amount:
Must be greater than $0
Cannot exceed maximum allowed amount per payer contract

Displayed in USD with 2 decimal places
3. Procedure Codes:
Must be valid CPT/HCPCS codes
Must be active on date of service
Require appropriate modifiers per coding guidelines
4. Diagnosis Codes:

Common User Questions & Answers
Navigation & Access
Q: How do I access the Claim Review module? A: From the main ImagineOne Software interface, click on

Q: What does the claim count at the top mean? A: The display "339 Claims (Total Charge Amount)
$250,342.10" shows the total number of claims currently displayed based on your filters, along with the sum of
all charge amounts across those claims.
Filtering & Searching
Q: How do I filter claims by insurance plan? A: Click the "Insurance Plan" dropdown in the Filters section at
the top of the screen. Select a specific insurance plan from the list, or leave it set to "(All)" to view claims across
all plans.
Q: What is the Paper toggle for? A: The Paper toggle allows you to filter between paper claims and electronic
claims. Toggle it on to see paper claims, or leave it off to view electronic claims.
Q: Can I search for a specific patient? A: While the Claim Review module shows a list of claims, you can sort
by Patient Name or Patient ID by clicking the respective column header. For specific patient searches, use the
"Account Inquiry" tab.
Q: How do I sort the claims list? A: Click any column header to sort by that column. Click once for ascending
order, click again for descending order.
Viewing Claim Details
Q: How do I see the charges for a claim? A: Click on the claim row you want to review. The row will expand
to show the charge details section below, which lists all charges associated with that claim.
Q: What does "1 Charge" or "2 Charges" mean? A: This indicates how many individual charge lines are
associated with the selected claim. Each charge represents a billable service or procedure.
Q: Where can I see the procedure codes? A: After selecting a claim, the charge details section will display the
"Procedure" column showing the CPT/HCPCS code and description for each charge.
Q: What do the diagnosis codes tell me? A: The "Diagnosis Codes" column shows the ICD-10 codes assigned
to each charge, which justify the medical necessity of the service performed.
Taking Actions
Q: How do I edit a claim? A: Select the claim by clicking on it, then right-click the claim row or click the
"Action" button in the bottom toolbar. Choose "Review Action" → "Edit Claim" from the menu.

Q: How do I place a claim on hold? A: Select the claim, access the action menu (right-click or "Action"
button), and choose "Hold Action" → "Hold \ Unhold". You can add a note explaining the hold reason by
selecting "Edit Hold Note".
Q: How do I release a claim for billing? A: Select the claim, open the action menu, and choose "Release
Action" → "Release". If the claim is on hold, you can select "Unhold And Release" to remove the hold and
release in one action.
Q: Can I hold all claims for a specific insurance plan at once? A: Yes. Filter to the specific insurance plan
using the dropdown, then use the action menu to select "Hold Action" → "Hold \ Unhold Plan". This will hold
all claims for that plan.
Q: What is the difference between "Reset" and "Delete"? A: "Reset" returns a claim to a previous state,
typically reversing recent changes or status updates. "Delete" permanently removes the claim from the system
(requires appropriate permissions and should be used with caution).
Warnings & Alerts
Q: What does "Timely Filing Warning = True" mean? A: This warning indicates the claim is approaching or
has passed the payer's timely filing deadline. Immediate action is needed to submit the claim before it's denied
for untimely filing.
Q: What does "Appeal Warning = True" mean? A: This flag indicates there may be an appeal deadline
approaching or the claim requires special handling related to an appeal process.
Q: How do I know if a claim is on hold? A: Check the "On Hold" column in the claims grid. If the field is
populated, the claim is on hold. If it's blank, the claim is not on hold.
Insurance & Patient Information
Q: What is the difference between "Insurance Carrier Name" and "Insurance Plan Name"? A:
"Insurance Carrier Name" is the high-level payer category (e.g., "CONTRACTS", "Other Comm."), while
"Insurance Plan Name" is the specific plan with details (e.g., "Insurance Plan 1009 (15 - OTH)").
Q: What does the number in parentheses mean in the insurance plan name? A: The format is "[Plan
Number] - [Plan Name] ([Type Code] - [Type])". For example, "Insurance Plan 1009 (15 - OTH)" means plan
number 1009, type code 15, and type "OTH" (Other).
Q: What are the insurance plan type codes? A: Common types include:
COMM = Commercial insurance
OTH/OTHER = Other insurance types
MCARE = Medicare
MCAID = Medicaid
AUTO = Auto insurance
WCOMP = Workers Compensation

Charges & Billing
Q: What is a POS Code? A: POS (Place of Service) Code is a 2-digit code indicating where the service was
performed. For example, "22" represents On Campus-Outpatient Hospital, "11" represents Office.
Q: What are modifiers? A: Modifiers are 2-character codes appended to procedure codes to provide additional
information about the service (e.g., "26" = professional component, "P1" = specific modifier for anesthesia).
Q: Can I see the total charges for a single claim? A: Yes, when you expand a claim, each charge line shows
its individual "Charge Amount". Sum these amounts to get the total for the claim.
Troubleshooting
Q: Why can't I release a claim? A: Common reasons include:
Claim is on hold (check "On Hold" column)
Missing required information (patient demographics, insurance, codes)
Validation errors (check for warnings or error messages)
Insufficient user permissions
Q: I don't see the claim I'm looking for. What should I check? A: Verify:
Your insurance plan filter isn't limiting the view
The Paper toggle is set correctly (paper vs. electronic)
The claim exists in the system (check Account Inquiry)
You have the correct date range or status filters applied
Q: How do I print a claim? A: Select the claim, access the action menu, and choose "Review Action" →
"Instant Print".
Q: Can I edit charges directly from the Claim Review screen? A: You can view charge details, but editing
typically requires opening the claim in edit mode via "Review Action" → "Edit Claim".
