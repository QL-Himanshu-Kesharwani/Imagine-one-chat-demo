NON POST MODULE – AI-READY FEATURE DOCUMENTATION
Product Context: Enterprise Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) Platform
Module Name: Non Post
Primary Domain: Charge Reconciliation / Exception Worklist Management
Audience: AI Support Bot, RCM Users, Billing Operations Teams
Version: Functional Documentation – AI Training Format

1. MODULE OVERVIEW

1.1 Definition
The Non Post Module is an operational worklist used to manage charges that 
have failed to post to the Patient Accounting System (PAS) or Billing System. 
These charges exist in an exception state and require manual review, validation, 
correction, and/or mapping before successful posting.
1.2 Purpose
The primary objective of the Non Post Module is to:
● Identify charges that did not successfully post
● Display related clinical/report data for review
● Allow correction of patient identifiers or visit information
● Facilitate reconciliation and validation
● Enable reprocessing or deletion of invalid records

1.3 Business Impact
Effective management of Non-Post charges:
● Prevents revenue leakage
● Reduces DNFB (Discharged Not Final Billed) delays
● Improves clean claim rate
● Minimizes manual billing errors
● Supports audit compliance

1. USER ROLES & ACCESS

2.1 Typical Users
● Charge Entry Team
● Billing Specialists
● RCM Analysts
● Revenue Integrity Team
● Patient Accounting Supervisors

2.2 Required Permissions
Users must have permissions to:
● View Non-Post worklist
● Access patient reports
● Edit charge metadata
● Validate and update records
● Delete (if role allows)

1. HIGH-LEVEL WORKFLOW



Step 1: User applies filters (Batch Number, Charge Filter, Mapping Pending)
Step 2: System loads Non-Post charges into worklist
Step 3: User selects a charge
Step 4: System displays:
- Charge details
- Associated report
- Possible patient matches
Step 5: User validates or corrects Patient ID / Visit Number / Location
Step 6: User clicks Validate or Update
Step 7: System reattempts posting logic
If successful → Charge moves out of Non Post
If unsuccessful → Remains in Non Post with updated reason

1. SCREEN STRUCTURE & UI COMPONENTS

4.1 Top Filter Panel
Fields:
● Download Toggle
● Batch Number (Dropdown – All / specific batch)
● Charge Filter (Dropdown – All / filtered states)
● Mapping Pending (Dropdown – All / Yes / No)
● Load Button

Function:
Controls which Non-Post charges populate in the worklist grid.
AI Response Logic:
If user asks "Why don’t I see my charge?" → Guide to check Batch Number and 
Mapping Pending filters.

4.2 Charges Worklist Grid
Columns:
● Patient ID
● Patient Name
● Visit Number
● Location

Displays:
Total number of Non-Post charges (e.g., “535 Charges”).
Purpose:
Provides a queue-based view of failed charges.
Behavior:
● Selecting a row loads corresponding report and charge info
● Grid supports scrolling
● Filter and gear icons allow column filtering and configuration

Common Non-Post Scenarios Visible in Grid:
● Patient ID = 0
● Invalid Visit Number



● Incorrect Location
● Missing mapping

4.3 Report Viewer Panel (Right Section)
Displays clinical or diagnostic report tied to the charge.
Typical Data Displayed:
● Patient Name
● DOB
● Referring Physician
● Reading Physician
● Exam Reason
● Report Text
● Dictation timestamps

Purpose:
Allows billing user to visually verify patient and encounter data against system 
record.
AI Interpretation Rule:
If report patient name differs from charge patient name → Suggest data 
mismatch review.

4.4 Charge Information Panel (Bottom Left)
Fields:
● Patient ID (Editable/Searchable)
● Visit Number (Editable/Searchable)
● Location (Editable/Searchable)
● Reason (System-generated error message)

Example Reason:
“Patient Information Not Found in the System.”
Purpose:
Allows correction of failed matching fields.
AI Response Logic:
If Reason indicates patient not found → Suggest verifying:
1. Correct MRN
2. Correct Visit Number
3. Correct Facility Location
4. Patient exists in PAS

4.5 Possible Matches Panel (Bottom Right)
Columns:
● Patient ID
● Visit ID
● Patient Name
● Date of Birth
● Visit Number
● Location
● Visit Date



● History Number
Purpose:
Displays potential patient/visit matches based on partial data.
Function:
User selects correct match to auto-populate Charge Information fields.
AI Guidance Rule:
If user asks “How do I fix incorrect patient?” → Direct to Possible Matches 
section.

4.6 Action Buttons
Validate
● Re-checks data against system rules
● Attempts posting logic
● If valid → removes from Non Post

Update
● Saves edited data without full validation

Delete
● Removes charge permanently (if authorized)

Patient Dropdown Menu Options:
● Account Inquiry
● Associated Documents
● Patient Edit
● Visit Edit
● Visit List

Close
● Exits module

1. SYSTEM ERROR TYPES (COMMON NON-POST REASONS)

5.1 Patient Not Found
Cause: Invalid Patient ID or MRN mismatch
Resolution: Correct Patient ID or search Possible Matches
5.2 Visit Not Found
Cause: Invalid or closed Visit Number
Resolution: Confirm correct encounter number
5.3 Location Mismatch
Cause: Charge tied to incorrect facility
Resolution: Update Location field
5.4 Mapping Pending
Cause: CPT, Modality, or Financial Class mapping missing
Resolution: Complete mapping in system configuration
5.5 Interface Failure
Cause: HL7 or charge interface transmission issue
Resolution: Escalate to IT / Interface team

1. VALIDATION LOGIC



When Validate is clicked, system checks:
1. Patient exists in Master Patient Index
2. Visit exists and is active
3. Location matches valid billing entity
4. Required financial mappings exist
5. No duplicate charge conditions

If all conditions pass → Charge posts to Billing
If any condition fails → Charge remains with updated Reason

1. DATA RELATIONSHIPS

Charge Record
→ Linked to Report
→ Linked to Patient
→ Linked to Visit
→ Linked to Location
→ Linked to CPT/Procedure Mapping
Non Post = Exception state of Charge Record

1. OPERATIONAL BEST PRACTICES

1. Review highest aging Non-Post charges first
2. Prioritize high-dollar procedures
3. Use Possible Matches instead of manual entry
4. Avoid deleting unless confirmed duplicate
5. Re-validate immediately after corrections
6. Monitor recurring errors for systemic issues

1. AI BOT TRAINING RULES

If user asks:
“Why is this charge in Non Post?”
→ Direct to Reason field explanation.
If user asks:
“How do I correct patient?”
→ Guide to Possible Matches → Select → Validate.
If user asks:
“What does Mapping Pending mean?”
→ Explain CPT/financial mapping configuration incomplete.
If user asks:
“Can I delete this charge?”
→ Confirm role permission and verify it is not needed for billing.
If user says:
“I validated but it still shows Non Post.”
→ Suggest checking updated Reason field and system mapping dependencies.



1. REPORTING & METRICS

Key KPIs tied to Non Post Module:
● Non-Post Volume
● Aging Days
● Reprocessing Success Rate
● Repeat Failure Rate
● Revenue Impact

Supervisors should monitor:
● Daily Non-Post count
● Top failure reasons
● User correction turnaround time

1. RISKS & COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS

● Incorrect patient mapping may cause HIPAA violation
● Deleting charges improperly may cause revenue loss
● Repeated manual overrides without root cause analysis creates 

systemic risk
Audit Trail Recommendation:
All updates, validations, and deletions must be logged with:
● User ID
● Timestamp
● Previous value
● New value

1. SUMMARY
The Non Post Module functions as a structured exception management queue 
within the RCM lifecycle. It ensures that charges failing automated posting rules 
are identified, corrected, validated, and reconciled before revenue submission. 
Proper usage directly improves billing accuracy, compliance integrity, and cash 
flow performance.
